    "The atmospheric concentration of CO$_2$ has been increasing from about 330 ppm in 1974 to about 410 ppm in 2019 (see figure 1). These data are collected by a dedicated network of atmospheric observation stations: <a href=\"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/iadv/\">https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/iadv/</a> (Check it out, it is an impressive network!). The data in figure 1 contains a wealth of information about the global carbon cycle, but it is not trivial to extract that information. A powerful method is to compare the observed concentrations in the real atmosphere with modeled concentrations, which describe our latest knowledge about the carbon cycle. The degree of comparison may be carefully used as an indication of how well we understand the underlying processes. This is what you will be doing today.\n",

    "5.2 Reflect on how good your final model is. What are strong aspects? What could be improved? How could you answer the question if the land and ocean sinks are proportional to the atmospheric CO2 concentration (i.e. they are relative sinks, not absolute ones)?\n",
