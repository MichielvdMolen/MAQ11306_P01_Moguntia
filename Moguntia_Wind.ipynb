    "# Wind fields in MOGUNTIA\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the MAQ11306 Air Quality Practical Manual, Moguntia is a global, 3D air quality model. To save computing time, the model uses coarse grid boxes (10 x 10 degrees, 10 vertical levels) and monthly average wind fields. Those wind fields are provided by the ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, ecmwf.int) weather model in 1987, because 1987 had winds (General Circulation, Monsoon, El Nino, jet streams) that were very close to climatology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will explore how the wind fields behave in Moguntia.\n",
